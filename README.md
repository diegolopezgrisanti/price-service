# Pricing API

## Overview

The Pricing API allows you to fetch the prices of a product at a specific date and time for a given brand. It returns a response with the price information, including start and end dates, currency, and the product details.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before starting:

- **Java** (JDK 21 or higher)  
  The application is built using Java, so you need to have JDK 21 or higher installed.

- **Maven** (for building and running the project)  
  Maven is used to manage project dependencies, build, and run the application.

## Local Environment Setup

### 1. **Database Configuration**

The service uses an **H2 database** to store product pricing information, including product IDs, brand IDs, price lists, effective dates, and pricing details. The database is embedded, so no additional setup is required.

### 2. Running the Service

To run the service locally:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start the service with the following command:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, you can use the green run button in your IDE for the `PriceServiceApplication` (main) class.

The service will be available at http://localhost:8080/

### 3. Running Tests

The project includes unit tests to ensure the accuracy of business logic. You can run all tests using Maven.

To run the tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```
Alternatively, if Maven is installed locally, you can use:

```bash
mvn test
```
The test suite verifies key functionalities of the API, including retrieving prices for various conditions and error handling.

## Endpoints

### 1. Get Price for Product
- **Endpoint**: `GET /prices`

This endpoint retrieves the price of a product based on the provided `productId`, `brandId`, and the date and time of the request.

#### Example Request:
```http
GET /prices?productId=35455&brandId=1&dateTime=2020-06-14T10:00:00
```

#### Request Parameters:

| Parameter   | Type          | Description                               | Example Value     |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `productId` | Integer       | ID of the product for price retrieval.     | 35455             |
| `brandId`   | Integer       | ID of the brand associated with the product. | 1                 |
| `dateTime`  | LocalDateTime | Date and time for the price request.       | 2020-06-14T10:00:00 |

#### Response Format
The response will return a `PriceResponseDTO` object with details such as the product ID, brand ID, price list, price amount, currency, and start and end dates.

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "product": {
    "id": 35455
  },
  "brand": {
    "id": 1
  },
  "priceList": 1,
  "startDate": "2020-06-14T00:00:00",
  "endDate": "2020-12-31T23:59:59",
  "finalPrice": 35.50,
  "currency": "EUR"
}
```
### Error Handling
In case of errors, the API will return a JSON object with an error message.

#### Example Error Response:
```json
{
  "message": "Product not found"
}
```
